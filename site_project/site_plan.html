    <h3> My Expirience At Grand Canyon National Park </h3>
    <p>
      To begin I chose to put Grand Canyon first because it is my favorite national park of the three I will be talking
      about. As a little background about the Grand Canyon, It was officially founded in 1919 but has been in formation
      for about 5 million years. The canyon was formed by the Colorado River which carved its way through rock still
      even today. The width of the Grand Canyon is massive with some parts being as wide as 18 miles. The full-length of
      the Grand Canyon is about 227 miles in length and is the second most visited national park in all of the United
      States.

      The last time I visited I was with my family and we were able to hike around 8 miles of the South Rim Trail. We
      started our trip by driving for four and a half hours until we arrived and got in line to board a shuttle. I
      mentioned earlier that a lot of people visit it and the lines are very long. Once we got on the shuttle we drove
      to the trailhead where we hiked along the southern rim trail. The trail was beautiful the whole way because you
      had a glorious view of the Grand Canyon the entire way. That is also why it is my favorite park because it has the
      best view and will knock your socks off.

    </ul>
    <h3>My Expirience At Zion National Park </h3>
    <p>
      Some background about Zion National Park is that it is a canyon just like the Grand Canyon however the river that
      formed it is called the Virgin River. It was founded in 1919 the same year as the Grand Canyon. Zion Canyon is a
      mix of erosion and river breaking through rock and has been in formation for nearly 240 million years. There are
      several trails in Zion but some of the more popular trails are the Narrows and Angels Landing trails. Angels
      Landing is a long zig-zag up a mountain until you get to the top where you can see the entire park with an
      astounding view. The Narrows is a 16-mile hike through a river with massive canyon walls on either side.

      The last time I was able to visit Zion I was able to hike Angels Landing. Angels Landing Is a pretty tough hike
      being 5.4 miles and having an elevation gain of nearly 1500 feet. Last summer I was able to hike the Narrows and
      Angels Landing was nothing compared to the Narrows. It's pretty much a 16-mile hike through a river however the
      water is only around 2 feet high for most of the hike. There are some spots that you might have to swim at but
      it's not too bad. The Narrows were not too hard for me but some of my family members got lost and had to spend the
      night in the canyon.

    <h3>My Expirience At Arches National Park And Q&A</h3>
    <p>
      A little background about Arches is it has around 2000 natural sandstone arches and was founded in 1929. The
      arches have been in formation for nearly 15 million years and were formed when erosion impacted sedimentary rock
      and formed arches. Arches and Zion are both in Utah but Arches is more famous because on the Utah license plate,
      you can find one of the famous arches pictured.

      The last time I was able to visit was this previous November and we were able to hike many trails and view many
      different arches. My favorite arch is called the Double Arch because it is the only major double arch in the
      entire park. You can climb up as well and I was able to capture some pretty good photography of the double arch.
      My favorite trail however is the broken arch trail because it has some of the best views of the different arches.
      It's a round trip of only 1.2 miles but has several different arches.
    </p>
    <h3>Q&A</h3>
    <p>
      Why will people come to your site?
      The main reason someone would want to see my website is to learn more about different national parks as well as my
      experience visiting the different national parks which to me are astounding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Main Purpose of website
      The main purpose of my website is to share my many trips and adventures with anyone interested. The main trips I
      will discuss are my trips to Arches National Park, Zion National Park, And The Grand Canyon. In other words, my
      website is to provide information on the parks and share my experience visiting them.
    </p>
    <p>
      What questions will your visitors expect your site to answer for them?
      Some of the basic questions someone might ask might include, Where are these national parks located? “What can I
      expect if I visit one day?”, and because most of the parks I talk about are just fascinating rocks how did they
      come to form?
    </p>
    <p>
      What types of activities will visitors want to complete on your site?
      Because it is mainly an information website the main thing you would do is read and look at beautiful pictures I
      was able to capture.
    </p>
    <p>
      What information is necessary to complete any actions your site offers?
      Because my site is just information about the different parks, I suggest using my website to get an inside look
      instead of the basic information you can find on Google. My website will be like my personal review of the
      different national parks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why will your visitors come to your site instead of another to get this information or complete the actions?
      The main reason somebody would choose my site over an alternative is because I can give my personal experience of
      the different national wonders and I can give more context for potential visitors to the different parks.
