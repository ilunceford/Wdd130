            <p>Some background about Zion National Park is that it is a canyon just like the Grand Canyon however the
                river that formed it is called the Virgin River. It was founded in 1919 the same year as the Grand
                Canyon. Zion Canyon is a mix of erosion and river breaking through rock and has been in formation for
                nearly 240 million years. There are several trails in Zion but some of the more popular trails are the
                Narrows and Angels Landing trails. Angels Landing is a long zig-zag up a mountain until you get to the
                top where you can see the entire park with an astounding view. The Narrows is a 16-mile hike through a
                river with massive canyon walls on either side.</p>

            <p>
                The last time I was able to visit Zion I was able to hike Angels Landing. Angels Landing Is a pretty
                tough hike being 5.4 miles and having an elevation gain of nearly 1500 feet. Last summer I was able to
                hike the Narrows and Angels Landing was nothing compared to the Narrows. It's pretty much a 16-mile hike
                through a river however the water is only around 2 feet high for most of the hike. There are some spots
                that you might have to swim at but it's not too bad. The Narrows were not too hard for me but some of my
                family members got lost and had to spend the night in the canyon.
