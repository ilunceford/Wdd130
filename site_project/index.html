            <h2>Historical Background About The Grand Canyon</h2>
            <p>
                To begin I chose to put Grand Canyon first because it is my favorite national park of the three I will
                be talking about. As a little background about the Grand Canyon, It was officially founded in 1919 but
                has been in formation for about 5 million years. The canyon was formed by the Colorado River which
                carved its way through rock still even today. The width of the Grand Canyon is massive with some parts
                being as wide as 18 miles. The full-length of the Grand Canyon is about 227 miles in length and is the
                second most visited national park in all of the United States.

            <h2>My Experience At Grand Canyon National Park</h2>
            <p>
                The last time I visited I was with my family and we were able to hike around 8 miles of the South Rim
                Trail.
                We started our trip by driving for four and a half hours until we arrived and got in line to board a
                shuttle. I mentioned earlier that a lot of people visit it and the lines are very long. Once we got on
                the shuttle we drove to the
                trailhead where we hiked along the southern rim trail. The trail was beautiful the whole way because you
                had a glorious view of the Grand Canyon the entire way. That is also why it is my favorite park because
                it has the best view and will knock your socks off. The photo below is a picture of me and my brothers
                at
                the beginning of the hike.
