                A little background about Arches is it has around 2000 natural sandstone arches and was founded in 1929.
                The arches have been in formation for nearly 15 million years and were formed when erosion impacted
                sedimentary rock and formed arches. Arches and Zion are both in Utah but Arches is more famous because
                on the Utah license plate, you can find one of the famous arches pictured. The last time I was able to
                visit was this previous November and we were able to hike many trails and view many different arches. My
                favorite arch is called the Double Arch because it is the only major double arch in the entire park. You
                can climb up as well and I was able to capture some pretty good photography of the double arch. My
                favorite trail however is the broken arch trail because it has some of the best views of the different
                arches. It's a round trip of only 1.2 miles but has several different arches.

                Q&A
                Why will people come to your site? The main reason someone would want to see my website is to learn more
                about different national parks as well as my experience visiting the different national parks which to
                me are astounding.
            </p>
            <p>
                Main Purpose of website: The main purpose of my website is to share my many trips and adventures with
                anyone interested. The main trips I will discuss are my trips to Arches National Park, Zion National
                Park, And The Grand Canyon. In other words, my website is to provide information on the parks and share
                my experience visiting them.
            </p>
            <p>
                What questions will your visitors expect your site to answer for them? Some of the basic questions
                someone might ask might include, Where are these national parks located? “What can I expect if I visit
                one day?”, and because most of the parks I talk about are just fascinating rocks how did they come to
                form?
            </p>
            <p>
                What types of activities will visitors want to complete on your site?
                Because it is mainly an information website the main thing you would do is read and look at beautiful
                pictures I was able to
                capture.
            </p>
            <p>
                What information is necessary to complete any actions your site offers?
                Because my site is just information about the different parks, I suggest using my website to get an
                inside look instead of the
                basic information you can find on Google. My website will be like my personal review of the different
                national parks.
            </p>
            <p>
                Why will your visitors come to your site instead of another to get this information or complete the
                actions? The main reason somebody would choose my site over an alternative is because I can give my
                personal experience of the different national wonders and I can give more context for potential visitors
                to the different parks.
